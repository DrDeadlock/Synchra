Dear Maria Trubacheva,  
  
thank you for putting your trust into me regarding the task assignment about the one way file synchronization program you asked for.  
  
During the process of designing and architecturing your application, some questions raised which have to be agreed with you (as my customer). If you don't wish a direct communication channel between the development department and the customer side, please feel free to redirect me to a lead developer or a consulting department, which usually are in charge for being the interface between development and customers.  
  
So, if you allow, let me inform you about application behaviours, we have to clarify:  
- Do you wish default Command Line Arguments (CLAs) for the time period and the Log File Path?  
- Do you want to choose a specific logging method on program startup or should all logging methods get used at the same time?  
- Are you aware of the fact, that user changes in the destination folder might get lost during the next synchronization cycle?  
-->Is this the behaviour you desire?  
-->Should the program log such events for you? (If so, I would add it onto the nice to have list and prioritize the task with my lead developer)  
- It may happen that error occur during the sync process (e.g. a file to remove is protected by the operating system). In such a case, I could log the errors for you  
--> DoÂ  you wish such error logs?  
--> Do you wish an external log file for errors or should errors get logged into the same file create/copy/remove infos are logged into?  
  
If you lack of time and this wall of questions is a TLDR for you, we can consider a short meeting so we can talk about those specifications in person.
