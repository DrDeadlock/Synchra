Framework: log4net
[Introduction](https://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/manual/introduction.html)

More than one Appender can be attached to a logger.
We will need the
	log4net.Appender.ConsoleAppender
		or
	log4net.Appender.ColoredConsoleAppender
and
	log4.net.Appender.FileAppender

We also might want to use a Layout on an appender.
